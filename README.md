<h1 style="color:#ffbf00; font-weight: 500">The Character Vault</h1>

This is a website that utilizes the Blizzard API to scan characters in bulk so you can keep track of all of your characters, your guild or just some random other people's characters. It was originally made to replace a spreadsheet I was maintaining for my characters and another I was maintaining for my guild to keep track of everyone's progress for gearing up. Simply input the character's name, server and region and the website will start tracking them, and then sort your characters with the tabs.
