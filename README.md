<h1 style="color:#ffbf00; font-weight: 500">The Character Vault</h1>

This is a website that utilizes the Blizzard API to scan characters in bulk so you can keep track of all of your characters, your guild or just some random other people's characters. It was originally made to replace a spreadsheet I was maintaining for my characters and another I was maintaining for my guild to keep track of everyone's progress for gearing up.

# Plans:

This website can track a lot of different things currently, and has plans for several more things

- [x] Class
- [x] Race
- [x] Guild
- [x] Level
- [x] Item Level
- [x] M+ Score
- [x] Raid Progress
- [x] Specialization
- [x] Role
- [x] Professions and their levels
- [x] Last time they logged in
- [x] A small head shot of the character
- [ ] Highest level mythic+ key for each dungeon
- [ ] Mythic+ keys done this and last week
- [ ] Highest parses for raid bosses
- [ ] Possibly collections tracking such as for mounts

### Compiling

It will even compile information about the characters and tell you things such as:

- [x] Highest level you have of any class
- [x] How many of a class you have
- [x] How many of a class at max level you have
- [x] How many of a class at max level you have on either faction
- [x] How many of a race you have
- [x] How many of a race at max level you have
